# StackServer
The project is an on-site test solution for a backend software developer position at http://www.fob-solutions.com.  
The time was limited to 1.5 hours, that were used to complete the exercise up to the state provided.

# Task
Design and implement client-server integer data stack web application.  
Each user connected should work with its own private stack (so, sessions need to be introduced).
* Back-end: standard push, pop and view API operations.  
* Front-end: a simplistic yet functional web interface is preferred.
